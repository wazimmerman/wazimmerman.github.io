Thanks for joining me in my journey to discover and share pratical applications for using code. By practical, I mostly mean using code in a way that makes life easier, more productive, and beneficial to others. I'll probably post regularly, and some of the stuff I post will probably have nothing to do with code, but it usually will. Mostly, this will be a scratch pad, *of sorts*, to log ideas and light bulb moments. At any rate, thanks for the opportunity to share my thoughts with you.
