So here goes, a "command-line application" (if you'll allow me to call it that), complete complete with *puts*, *gets*, defined *methods*, *conditionals*, and of course variables. In a week, I'll find this the product of a total noobie Rubyist (if you'll allow me to call myself that), but for now, this is an application that I created in 10 minutes. I kinda find it funny, but I also laugh at my own jokes (50% of the time others aren't laughing, so there's that). Check 'er out below:
